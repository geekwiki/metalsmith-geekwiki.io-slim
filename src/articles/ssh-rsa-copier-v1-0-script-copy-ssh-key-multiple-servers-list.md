We've all been there, you're sitting at work and your boss gives you a task and you immediately get frustrated because not only is it one of the most annoying jobs to do but it also will consume a lot of your time. This happened to me at an old company that I worked for, because whenever a new person would get hired we would have to manually copy their SSH keys to all of the servers that we had (hundreds of servers!). If you love to code like I do, it immediately turns into a project for yourself to automate it so you don't have to deal with it in the future. That is why I created this script. This is just to use as reference (it still works) but I would actually recommend using something called [pssh-copy-id](https://github.com/Ruyk/pssh-copy-id) instead of this script now but back when I created this script I didn't even know it existed.

Also please note, this is definitely not some of my best work.. Don't hold it against me! :)
