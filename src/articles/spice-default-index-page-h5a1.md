It's a very bad idea to list the contents of a web directory. That being said, there are always exceptions to the rule. For example, I have an Apache server at my house that you can only get to from within the network, and I like to just browse to it and download whatever I need, without having to know the exact path or filename.

#### Features

It provides a much richer interface, and some extra features that Apache/Nginx or any other HTTP service.

*   Breadcrumb and tree view for faster browsing
*   Different view modes
*   Auto refresh of folder content
*   Custom header and/or footer for each directory
*   Packaged download of selected content (tar and zip supported)
*   Filter for displayed files and folders
*   Folder sizes
*   Localization with lots of languages already included
*   Image and text file preview (including Markdown rendering)
*   Thumbnails for images, movies and PDFs
*   QR codes on hovering files
*   Sorting by name, date or size

#### Installation

The installation is pretty straight forward, you just download the zip file (or even better, use wget), then copy the __h5ai_ folder and its contents to the root of the virtual hosts directory. Then add _/_h5ai/server/php/index.php_ to the _DirectoryIndex_ attribute (assuming you're using Apache). Thats pretty much it. There are more details on the install on the [**homepage**](http://larsjung.de/h5ai/).

#### Configuration

There really isn't much to configure, but all of the configuration directives are located at in the **_h5ai/conf/options.json** file. The only change I had to make was to enable the _foldersize_ attribute. But there are all kinds of things, like enabling the ability to delete file/folders. The other configuration attributes are: _autorefresh, crumb, custom, delete, dropbox, download, filter, foldersize, google-analytics, l10n, link-hover-states, mode, piwik-analytics, preview-img, preview-txt, qrcode, rename, select, sort, statusbar, thumbnails, title, tree
